		"For future work, we intend to use ProMoBox in a case study for gestural interaction [31]. In this case study, we plan to do more research on the performance of model checking using ProMoBox.",
		"Moreover, we plan to investigate how different property languages can be supported using different templates, and how these templates can be re-used, e.g., an existing template for structural properties could be re-used in the properties template that is presented in this paper.",
		"We are also interested in broadening the types of languages that are supported by ProMoBox, e.g., languages that explicitly include time. We expect that this would typically result in investigating associated templates for real-time properties"
